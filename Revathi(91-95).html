<hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black; ">
<p><i>Health information privacy is one of the most important and contentious areas in the<br>
    development of Health Knowledge Systems. This chapter provides an overview of some<br>
    of the daily privacy and security issues currently faced by health services, as health<br>
    knowledge system developments risk outpacing medico-legal and professional<br>
    structures. The focus is a mixture of philosophy and pragmatics with regard to the key<br>
    “privacy” and “security” issues that challenge stakeholders as they try to implement<br>
    and maintain an increasing array of electronic health knowledge management systems.<br>
    The chapter utilises a number of evolving simple visual and mnemonic models or<br>
    concepts based on observations, reflections and understanding of the literature.</i></p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; padding-left: 30%;"><b>Introduction</b></p>
<hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black; ">
<p>The focus of this chapter is largely shaped by the common themes and thoughts<br>
    expressed, and dilemmas experienced, within the environment in which the Author works.<br>
    However many of these local opinions are shaped by more universal forces, media, and<br>
    experiences, and common themes, concepts and challenges can be found internationally,<br>
    both within health, and other complex systems that handle personal information (Ander-<br>son, 1996; Coiera & Clarke, 2003; Tang, 2000). Health Knowledge Management systems<br>
    are assisted by processes that provide complete, accurate, and timely information. Issues<br>
    of security and privacy have the capacity to facilitate or inhibit this process. However,<br>
    there are a myriad of perspectives with regard to the meaning, significance, and<br>
    interrelation of the terms privacy, security, and health knowledge system, which shall be<br>
    discussed throughout the chapter.</p>
<p>A Health Knowledge system should aim to integrate and optimise stakeholders’ “capac-<br>ity to act” (Sveiby, 2001) or “capacity to C.A.R.E.” (that is, the capacity to deliver in a<br>
    coordinated fashion the integral Clinical, Administrative, Research and Educational<br>
    functions of healthcare). The Electronic Patient Record term typically aims to describe<br>
    the technology or software that stores the record of care or provides a degree of decision<br>
    support. However, the term “Health Knowledge Management System” aims to better<br>
    capture or identify the overall system changes required to implement decision support<br>
    systems, such as changes in underlying processes and the development of a culture that<br>
    values, respects and protects the acquisition, distribution, production and utilisation of<br>
    available knowledge in order to achieve better outcomes for patients (Standards Aus-<br>tralia, 2001; Wyatt, 2001).</p>
<p>A Health Knowledge Management System should facilitate closing the communication<br>
    gaps on an ongoing basis, between all the key stakeholders involved in optimising care,<br>
    GPs, Allied health services (including hospitals), and the often forgotten Patients and</p><br>

<p>their Supports, who all need and should benefit from an improved “capacity to C.A.R.E.”<br>
    The system should also aim to be fast, intuitive, robust, stable, and trustworthy (Orr,<br>
    2000).</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; padding-left: 20%;"><b>Privacy and Security</b></p>
<hr style="height: 2px; color: black; background-color: black; ">
<p>Internationally there is a growing array of privacy and security codes, laws, and<br>
    standards with many shared core themes (Office of the Privacy Commissioner, 2002;<br>
    Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand, 2001). However, creating a shared<br>
    understanding of the essential nature of “Privacy” continues to afford particular<br>
    challenges, as many of its associated elements are contextual, perceptual and personal.<br>
    Clarke (2004) and Anderson (2004) provide comprehensive resources exploring the<br>
    dimensions and complexities of privacy, security, and related concepts.</p>
<p>There is the potential for conflict, as well as the need for balance between the hierarchy<br>
    of needs (Maslow, 1943) or wants of an individual or a particular group, versus the needs,<br>
    and wants and capabilities of the wider community or system. The original Latin origin<br>
    of the word “Privacy” aims to convey a sense of something “set apart”, owned by oneself<br>
    rather than the state or public (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2001). Therefore we could<br>
    view private information as something we feel ownership of or particularly connected to,<br>
    information that should be “set apart” and out of the public domain, or at least over which<br>
    we should have particular control and an understanding of the competence and motiva-<br>tion of those who may use it.</p>
<p>However with regard to our health (and accordingly our health information) we are rarely<br>
    truly “set apart” from the public or our communities. Our health, our health management,<br>
    and our behaviour are continually impacted on by the complex biopsychosocial (Engel,<br>
    1977) system in which we live. The need or desire to be “set apart” or have control can<br>
    lead to conflict or at least opportunity costs with the needs of other aspects of the finely<br>
    balanced system within which we function. Each stakeholder group may attribute<br>
    different weights to different factors and believe the balance should lie to one side or the<br>
    other</p>
<p>The Latin origin of the word “Security” conveys the sense of something safe or without<br>
    care (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2001). Security with respect to Information Systems<br>
    typically focuses on the preservation of confidentiality integrity, and availability.<br>
    Confidentially refers to the need to limit access only to those authorised to have access,<br>
    integrity refers to ensuring the completeness and accuracy of information and associated<br>
    system processes while availability refers to the need to ensure that information and<br>
    associated system processes are accessible to authorised users when required (Stan-<br>dards Australia/New Zealand, 2001).</p>
<p>Perceptions of privacy and sub-optimal care risk according to degree of information flow<br>
    can be depicted by way of a schematic (Figure 1).</p>
<p>As a background to a discussion on the challenges of privacy impact assessment and<br>
    informed consent or “e-consent” systems, it is worth trying to stimulate a shared</p><hr><hr><br>
<p><i>Figure 1. Privacy versus sub-optimal care risk: Possible clinician view</i></p>
<img src="C:\Users\my pc\OneDrive\Desktop\html1/Diagram1.JPG" style="padding-left: 10%;"><br><br>
<p>conceptual understanding, of some of the perceptions of what the impacts or risks and<br>
    benefits of a health knowledge management system might be. As a beginning, we might<br>
    consider Figure 1, which illustrates how a clinician might perceive the relative decrease<br>
    in sub-optimal care risk and increase in privacy risk as health information increasingly<br>
    flows and is shared and integrated.</p>
<p>Privacy risk is defined as the perceived risk of an adverse outcome or sub-optimal care<br>
    related to a privacy infringement. Sub-optimal care risk is defined as the perceived risk<br>
    of non-optimal care related to information flow restriction or disintegration.</p>
<p>The focus of electronic health knowledge management system value analysis is often on<br>
    preventing death or adverse events. However there is a whole range of care that, although<br>
    it does not result in a reported adverse event or death, could be described as non- or sub-<br>optimal. A health outcomes curve (Figure 2) may have optimal care at one end with<br>
    everything else considered increasingly sub-optimal as it moves through various<br>
    degrees of poorly co-ordinated and inefficient care, towards adverse events, permanent<br>
    disability and death at the other end. This poorly co-ordinated or inefficient care may for<br>
    example include duplication of assessment or investigation or the use of expensive or<br>
    multiple interventions, without evidence of greater benefit over a cheaper or single<br>
    intervention or simply failing to stop or review an intervention.</p><br>
